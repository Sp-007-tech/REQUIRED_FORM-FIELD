# REQUIRED_FORM-FIELD

In this project shows that how to make input fields required and create an error message if needed.

In this code we added some new variable i.e $nameErr, $genderErr, $websiteErr. These error variables will hold error messages for the required fields.
we have also added an 'if-else' statement for each $_POST variable. This checks if the $_POST variable is empty with the "PHP  empty()" function. If it is empty,an error message is stored in the different error variable, and if it is not empty,it sends the user input data throught the 'test_input()' function.

Then in the HTML form, there is a little script after each required field, which generates the correct error message..

That's all about Form Fields Required.

Explorer all !!
